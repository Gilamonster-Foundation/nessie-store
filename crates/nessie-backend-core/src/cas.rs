//! The content-addressed storage backend contract.
//!
//! [`CasBackend`] is a **distinct backend family** from the volume supertrait
//! stack in [`crate::traits`]. Its noun is a [`Digest`] — a hash of bytes — not a
//! [`VolumeUuid`](crate::VolumeUuid), so it is deliberately *not* a tier of
//! `VolumeBackend`. A substrate may implement both families; they compose, they
//! do not nest. This is the P2P-native substrate the swarm is built on
//! (`docs/design/p2p-cas-swarm.md`).

/// Immutable content-addressed blob storage — the P2P-native substrate.
///
/// A `CasBackend` stores and serves opaque byte blobs keyed by their [`Digest`].
/// The contract is intentionally tiny — `has` / `get` / `put` — because content
/// addressing carries the rest: keys are *computed from content*, integrity is
/// self-verifying, and identical blobs deduplicate automatically.
///
/// `Send + Sync` so the daemon can hold one behind an `Arc<dyn CasBackend>` and
/// dispatch from many async tasks, exactly as it does for `VolumeBackend`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// The trait is object-safe — the daemon dispatches through a trait object:
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use nessie_backend_core::CasBackend;
///
/// fn store(_backend: Arc<dyn CasBackend>) { /* ... */ }
/// ```

    /// Whether this node holds the blob for `digest` locally (no network fetch).
    ///

    /// error); a plain "not present" is `Ok(false)`, not an error.
